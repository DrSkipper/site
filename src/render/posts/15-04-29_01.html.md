Hey everybody! Thanks for visiting my site! Some exciting developments in my life have left me with the opportunity to spend more time working on games than I've been able to for the last couple years, so I figured I'd get this new and slightly better but still pretty crappy website up and running so people can read about what I'm working on! I have one project I've started on with some old friends that I'm looking forward to sharing more of, and in addition to that I'll probably start by revisiting some jam games and older experiments I've worked on. I also have some more long term projects in the works I'm hoping to get going on more seriously pretty soon. Looking forward to sharing more but for now it's probably best to follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/DrSkipper_) if you're interested in what I'll be doing!
