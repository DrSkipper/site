Hey there, I'm Fletcher and I'm a game creator, programmer, community organizer, TowerFall player and I like doing outdoorsy things too sometimes. My employment situation has recently allowed me more time to work on my own games so hopefully we'll be seeing more of that :) Feel free to head over to my <a href="pages/posts.html">posts</a> to check out what I'm working on, or take a look at the <a href="pages/games.html">games</a> tab for some games I've worked on recently-ish. The best way to stay up to date with what I'm doing is to follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/DrSkipper_">twitter</a>. Hope all is well and that you like what you find here!
